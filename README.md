# Philly-Crime-Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts a detailed analysis of crime patterns in Philadelphia, examining how different locations and times influence the nature and frequency of crimes. Utilizing data spanning from 2011 to 2023, the initiative sheds light on crime distribution and timing, aiming to aid in the development of effective crime prevention and policy strategies.

## Project Objectives
- Investigate the impact of time and day on the incidence of various types of crimes.
- Analyze geographical crime distribution across Philadelphia to identify high-risk zones.
- Uncover patterns that could assist law enforcement agencies and policymakers in formulating targeted interventions.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises over two million records detailing crimes in Philadelphia, including types such as assault, homicide, and theft, with each incident categorized by the hour and day of occurrence. Information on the crime category, zip code, and incident count allows for a nuanced exploration of citywide crime trends.

## Key Findings
- Zip code 19134 (Kensington) exhibits a notably high crime rate, with a 245% increase in incidents compared to other areas.
- Violent crimes predominantly occur in and around Kensington, with significant activity also noted in the 19143 and 19139 zip codes.
- Thefts from automobiles peak near major sporting venues, potentially linked to the large parking facilities at these sites.
- University City emerges as a hotspot for fraud, diverging from the patterns observed for other crime types.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Data was sourced from OpenDataPhilly, including detailed records of arrests and crime incidents.
- **Analysis**: Leveraged Python for data preprocessing and analysis, with a specific focus on examining crimes by zip code, day, and time.
- **Visualization**: Visual aids were created to illustrate the study's findings, utilizing Tableau for effective geospatial representation.

## Usage
Target users include:

- Law enforcement agencies looking to optimize patrol strategies and preventive measures.
- Policymakers aiming to develop informed, area-specific crime reduction policies.
- Academic researchers interested in urban crime dynamics.

## Access and Distribution
Analyzed data is available in CSV format, supplemented by a Tableau workbook (PhillyCrimeByZip.twbx) for visual analysis.

## Limitations
The project acknowledges certain limitations, including incomplete data records and missing variables, which could provide additional context to the findings.
